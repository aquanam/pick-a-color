# pick-a-color
It's simple. A python project that lets you choose a color.
# Basics
When you first start the program, you'll see something that may look like this:

The GUI isn't the best, but still, it works.

When you press the "Pick a color" button, a color chooser comes up like this:

You can do many things with the color chooser, but I am not going to include what you can do with it, because unfortunatley it has more knobs then an aeroplane (exaggerated).

However, if you don't choose a color, a messagebox comes up like this:

I mean, makes sense. If you chose nothing for the color, don't change the current color (this is me patting my own back because I coded this).

If you do though, a messagebox will come up like this:

It shows you the hex value and rgb value of your chosen color, and it tells you that do you want set the color as the chosen color. If you choose yes it sets the color you chose, and if you chose no it doesn't.

But look what happens when you choose yes:

It sets the background to your chosen color! Impressive, isn't it? Well, not really. But still, really cool.

When you click on the "Disable messageboxes" button, you may notice that the text in the button has changed to "Enable messageboxes" like this:
